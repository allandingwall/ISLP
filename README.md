# An Introduction to Statistical Learning – Python Portfolio

This repository contains concise, chapter-aligned Python implementations and exploratory analyses based on *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*. Each notebook demonstrates core statistical learning methods using modern Python tools, with a focus on clear modelling workflows, practical evaluation, and reproducible results.

## Structure
- **notebooks/** — Chapter-based Jupyter notebooks  
- **data/** — Raw and processed datasets  
- **requirements.txt** — Project dependencies

To get started, create a virtual environment, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the analyses.
